    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including IP address, hostname, username, and directory paths, then sends this data via HTTP requests to third-party domains. This constitutes a clear data exfiltration pattern where system metadata is transmitted without explicit user consent. The use of http instead of https, combined with disabling SSL verification, creates significant security vulnerabilities and allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.",
