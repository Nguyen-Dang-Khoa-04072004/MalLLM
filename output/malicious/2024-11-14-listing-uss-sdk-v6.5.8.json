    "analysis": "This code appears to be a malicious package that collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user information, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. The purpose is likely to track users' systems without their knowledge or consent, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance or data harvesting.",
    "conclusion": "This is a high-risk malicious package that exfiltrates sensitive system information to an external Discord webhook. It represents a significant security threat.",
