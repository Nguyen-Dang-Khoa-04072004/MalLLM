    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system and package metadata and sends it to a hard-coded Discord webhook. It retrieves both internal and external IP addresses using DNS resolution and external APIs. The collected data includes usernames, hostnames, IP addresses, DNS settings, and package information. This behavior strongly indicates telemetry or tracking functionality, potentially used for monitoring or malicious purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear telemetry/tracking behavior with potential security implications due to hardcoded credentials and data exfiltration to an external service.",
