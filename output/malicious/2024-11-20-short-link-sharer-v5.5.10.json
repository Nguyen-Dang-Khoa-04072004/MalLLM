    "analysis": "This code performs several concerning actions: 1) It collects extensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, user details, and package metadata, 2) It sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint, 3) It uses an external API call to fetch external IP information, 4) The code includes a suspiciously named property ___resolved in package.json which may indicate tampering or obfuscation. The purpose is clearly telemetry/tracking rather than legitimate functionality.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. It violates privacy by collecting system information without consent and sends it to a third-party service.",
