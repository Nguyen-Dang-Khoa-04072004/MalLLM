    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS servers, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this information to a Discord webhook. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission to third-party services. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates this is likely part of a malicious package designed to exfiltrate user data.",
