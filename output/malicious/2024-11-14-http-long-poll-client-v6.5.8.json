    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects various system information including internal IP address, external IP address, hostname, username, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is highly suspicious as it constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration without explicit user consent. The code also uses a custom function to get the internal IP address and makes an HTTPS request to ipinfo.io to fetch external IP details, which is typical of tracking/spyware behavior.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity related to unauthorized data collection and transmission to external servers.",
