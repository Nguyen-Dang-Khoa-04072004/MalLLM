        "Potential exposure of internal network information through external IP lookup",
        "Use of unverified external API for IP resolution without proper error handling"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system and network information including internal IP addresses, external IP addresses via ipinfo.io, hostnames, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint, potentially exposing sensitive system information to an external party. The code does not implement any validation or sanitization of the collected data before transmission.",
    "conclusion": "This code presents a significant security risk by transmitting sensitive system information to an external webhook without user consent or knowledge. The hardcoded Discord webhook URL suggests this may be part of a tracking mechanism or telemetry system.",
