    "analysis": "This module collects comprehensive system and package information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then transmits all this data via HTTPS to a Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior constitutes a privacy and security risk because it exposes potentially sensitive network and system information to an external party without user consent. The hardcoded webhook URL suggests this is likely part of a telemetry or tracking mechanism.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to an external service.",
