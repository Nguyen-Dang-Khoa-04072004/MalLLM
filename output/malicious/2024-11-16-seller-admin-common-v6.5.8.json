{
    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS settings, and package metadata, then sends this data to a Discord webhook for tracking purposes.",
    "analysis": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting extensive system information including internal IP addresses, hostnames, user credentials, and package metadata, then transmitting this data to a remote Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of sensitive OS-level information strongly indicates this is telemetry or tracking code designed to exfiltrate data from compromised systems. The use of external services like ipinfo.io for IP resolution and the sending of structured JSON data to Discord suggests this was likely created for surveillance or data harvesting purposes."
