    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data to known tracking domains through HTTP requests with disabled SSL verification. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or data collection functionality often found in malware or spyware. The hardcoded domain names suggest it's communicating with a specific third-party service.",
