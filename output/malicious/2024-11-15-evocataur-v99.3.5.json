    ],
    "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system information such as MAC addresses and user details, then transmits this data to third-party domains via HTTP requests. The presence of hardcoded domain names suggests potential tracking or data exfiltration behavior. The disabling of SSL certificate verification increases security risk by making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits behavior consistent with data collection and exfiltration, potentially for tracking purposes. It poses a significant security risk due to the transmission of system information and insecure HTTP practices.",
