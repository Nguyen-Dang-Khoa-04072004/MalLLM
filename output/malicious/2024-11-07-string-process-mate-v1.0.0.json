    "purpose": "This code appears to implement a malicious backdoor or botnet client that spreads itself to other systems, connects to a remote command and control server, and executes arbitrary commands received from the server.",
    "sources": [
        "file system read operations (fs.readFileSync)",
        "network socket connections (net.Socket)",

        "Execution of arbitrary commands via remote C2 server",
        "Background execution of malicious script post-installation"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code implements multiple malicious behaviors: it copies itself to common temporary directories, attempts to connect to specific IP addresses to spread, establishes persistent connections to a command-and-control server, and executes arbitrary commands received over the network. The postinstall.js file ensures the malware runs in the background after installation. This is clearly malicious code designed for unauthorized system access and propagation.",
    "conclusion": "This code is highly likely to be malicious software (malware) implementing a backdoor botnet client with self-propagation capabilities.",
