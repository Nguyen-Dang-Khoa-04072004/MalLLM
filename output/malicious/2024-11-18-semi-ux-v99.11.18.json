    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then encodes this data and sends it to multiple external domains. The presence of hardcoded domains typically used in tracking or penetration testing suggests this code could be part of a telemetry or monitoring mechanism. The 'rejectUnauthorized: false' setting in the HTTP request indicates potential attempts to bypass SSL certificate validation, which is a common tactic in malicious software.",
    "conclusion": "This code has characteristics of telemetry or monitoring software that gathers system information and transmits it to external servers, with potential security implications due to insecure communication practices.",
