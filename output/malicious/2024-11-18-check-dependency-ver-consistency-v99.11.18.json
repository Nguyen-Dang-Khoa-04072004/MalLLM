    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then establishes HTTP connections to known malicious domains (oast.fun, oast-cn.byted-dast.com) with disabled SSL verification. This behavior strongly indicates malicious activity aimed at system surveillance or data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding and hardcoded domains suggests an attempt to obfuscate the malicious intent.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malware behavior including system information collection, outbound communication to suspicious domains, and disabling of security features. It's highly likely this is part of a tracking or surveillance tool.",
