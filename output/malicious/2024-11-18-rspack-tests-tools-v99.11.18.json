    "analysis": "This code collects various system identifiers such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user information. It then encodes this data and sends it to external domains using HTTP requests. The presence of hardcoded domain names associated with tracking services (like oast-cn.byted-dast.com and oast.fun) indicates potential data exfiltration behavior. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests insecure communication practices. This pattern is commonly associated with telemetry, tracking, or potentially malicious data collection.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior related to system information collection and data exfiltration. It poses a medium security risk due to potential unauthorized data transmission.",
