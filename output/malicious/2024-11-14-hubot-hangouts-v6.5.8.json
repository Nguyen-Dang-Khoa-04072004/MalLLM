    ],
    "analysis": "This code performs system reconnaissance by collecting various identifiers and sending them to a Discord webhook. The hardcoded webhook URL suggests it's designed to transmit data to a specific third-party service. It gathers both internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user information, DNS configuration, and package metadata. This behavior is typical of telemetry or monitoring code, but when combined with a hardcoded webhook destination, it becomes concerning as it could be used for unauthorized data exfiltration without user knowledge or consent.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior through its automated data collection and exfiltration capabilities to an external Discord webhook. The combination of system information gathering with hardcoded communication endpoints makes this a high-risk component.",
