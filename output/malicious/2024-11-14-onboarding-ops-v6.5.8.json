    "analysis": "This code collects comprehensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS configuration, and package metadata. It then transmits all this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code exhibits clear signs of telemetry or tracking functionality, sending personal system information to an external service without explicit user consent. The presence of the ipinfo.io API call suggests it's trying to gather geolocation and network information as well.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for data exfiltration. It collects extensive system and network information and sends it to a remote Discord webhook, potentially violating privacy and security policies.",
