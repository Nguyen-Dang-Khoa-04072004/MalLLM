{
    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS settings, and package details, then sends this data via HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system and package metadata, including both internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and user information. It then transmits all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, suggesting potential malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The presence of the hardcoded webhook URL is highly suspicious, and the collection of sensitive system information without explicit user consent raises serious privacy and security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics of malware or unwanted software by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server without clear disclosure or user consent.",
    "confidence": 0.95
