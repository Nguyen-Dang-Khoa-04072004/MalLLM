    ],
    "analysis": "The code implements a backdoor that establishes a persistent TCP connection to a remote server at 54.90.237.9:9797. It retrieves the victim's external IP address using an external API and sends it back to the attacker. The code then allows arbitrary command execution through the established connection by spawning bash processes. It includes reconnect logic and error handling to maintain persistence. This is highly indicative of malicious software designed for remote system control.",
    "conclusion": "Strong evidence of malicious backdoor functionality with remote access capabilities, information exfiltration, and command execution.",
