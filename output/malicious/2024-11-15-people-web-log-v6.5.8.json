    "analysis": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting comprehensive system information including IP addresses, usernames, hostnames, and package metadata, then exfiltrating it to a Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL strongly suggests this is part of a command and control infrastructure. The code also appears to have obfuscated elements (___resolved) and lacks any user consent mechanism for data collection.",
    "conclusion": "This is highly likely malicious software that collects system information and sends it to a remote server, constituting a security risk and potential data exfiltration threat.",
