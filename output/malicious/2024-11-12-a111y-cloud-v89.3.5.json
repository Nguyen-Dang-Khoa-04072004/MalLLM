    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then encodes this data and sends it to external domains via HTTP GET requests. These domains appear to be part of tracking infrastructure based on their naming patterns. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates potential insecurity in SSL/TLS handling.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code exhibits behavior consistent with telemetry or tracking software that collects and transmits device identifiers to remote servers without proper security measures.",
