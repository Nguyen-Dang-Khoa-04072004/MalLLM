    "analysis": "This code performs network reconnaissance by gathering internal and external IP addresses, system metadata, and package information. It then sends all this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating potential data exfiltration capabilities. The code lacks any form of user consent mechanism and appears designed to silently collect and transmit system information to a third-party service.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external Discord webhook without user knowledge or consent. This constitutes a security risk as it enables unauthorized data collection and potential surveillance.",
