    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal/external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS settings, user information, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The purpose appears to be telemetry or tracking, which could pose privacy risks if used without explicit user consent. The external IP lookup uses a public API, which may also introduce additional attack vectors or data leakage.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code collects and transmits potentially sensitive system information to an external service without clear user consent. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates intentional data exfiltration.",
