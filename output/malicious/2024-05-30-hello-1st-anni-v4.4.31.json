    "analysis": "The code contains multiple functions that perform DNS lookups and send the resulting data to a remote server. It also includes functionality for downloading and executing files, which could indicate malicious behavior. The presence of hardcoded URLs and obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide the true intent of the code.",
