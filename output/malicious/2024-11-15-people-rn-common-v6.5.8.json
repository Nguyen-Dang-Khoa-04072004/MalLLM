    "analysis": "This code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by collecting extensive system information including IP addresses, user credentials, and package metadata, then transmitting this data to a remote Discord webhook. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates intentional data exfiltration. The code makes external HTTP requests to ipinfo.io to fetch external IP information and uses multiple OS-level APIs to gather system details. There is no user consent or opt-in mechanism, making this a clear example of unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for data exfiltration. It collects comprehensive system information and sends it to a remote Discord webhook without user consent.",
