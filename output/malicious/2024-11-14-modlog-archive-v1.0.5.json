    "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious module that collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server via HTTPS POST requests. It gathers network interface details, public IP address, hostname, user information, and current working directory.",

    "anomalies": [
        "Use of child_process.execSync for external commands",
        "Silent error handling in HTTP request with no logging or retry mechanism",
        "Hardcoded C2 endpoint URL",
        "Exfiltration of sensitive system information",
        "Use of process.stdout.write instead of standard logging"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by collecting system fingerprinting data including network interfaces, public IP, hostname, user information, and current directory. This data is then sent to a hardcoded webhook endpoint via HTTPS POST requests. The implementation uses silent error handling which prevents detection of connection issues, making it more persistent. The use of execSync for external commands like 'curl' and 'pwd' indicates potential privilege escalation attempts or information gathering for further attacks.",
    "conclusion": "This code is highly likely malicious, functioning as a data exfiltration module that harvests system information and sends it to a remote command-and-control server.",
