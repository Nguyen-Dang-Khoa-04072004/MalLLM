    "analysis": "This code contains a clear security risk through hardcoded credentials and data exfiltration. The Discord webhook URL is hardcoded and could allow unauthorized parties to receive sensitive system information. It collects various system identifiers including IP addresses, hostnames, and user information, which when sent to an external service creates a significant privacy and security risk. The code lacks any form of consent mechanism or encryption for the transmitted data.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to hardcoded webhook URL, potential data exfiltration, and transmission of sensitive system information without proper safeguards.",
