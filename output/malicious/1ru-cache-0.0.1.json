    "purpose": "The code implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with optional expiration and eviction policies. It manages a bounded set of key-value pairs, removing the least recently used items when the cache exceeds its maximum size or age.",

    "sinks": [],
    "flows": [],
    "anomalies": [
        "Potential denial-of-service vulnerability due to unbounded memory growth if maxAge is not properly enforced",
        "Use of naiveLength function as default length calculator could lead to incorrect cache size calculations if not overridden"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code defines an LRU cache implementation using a combination of a Map for fast key lookups and a Yallist for maintaining usage order. Key features include configurable maximum size, optional expiration times, and disposal callbacks. The code handles edge cases like oversized entries and stale entries but lacks explicit input validation for potentially malicious data passed through the public API methods.",
    "conclusion": "The implementation appears secure against direct injection attacks but has potential resource exhaustion risks if not properly configured. The cache uses standard JavaScript data structures and does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to code execution or information disclosure.",
