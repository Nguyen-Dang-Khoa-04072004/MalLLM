    "anomalies": [
        "Use of process.stdout.write() instead of proper logging or error handling",
        "Direct exposure of system information (hostname, user info) through stdout",
        "Potential insecure data transmission via https.request without proper validation"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code retrieves system information using os module functions and sends HTTP requests. It writes data to stdout which could expose sensitive information. The use of process.stdout.write() is unusual for a production environment and may indicate a debugging or development state. The HTTPS request lacks proper error handling and input validation.",
    "conclusion": "The code has potential security implications due to exposing system information and improper data handling. It should not be used in production without significant modifications.",
