    "analysis": "This code collects comprehensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS servers, hostname, user info, and package details. It then sends this data via HTTPS to a Discord webhook, which could indicate malicious behavior such as data theft or botnet communication. The use of hardcoded credentials and sending sensitive data over unencrypted channels raises serious security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "This is highly suspicious code that likely constitutes malware due to its data exfiltration capabilities and sending system information to an external service without user consent.",
