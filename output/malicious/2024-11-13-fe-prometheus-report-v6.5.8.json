    "purpose": "The code appears to be collecting system information including IP addresses, hostnames, package details, and user information, then sending this data via HTTPS POST to a Discord webhook endpoint.",
    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system and package information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which indicates potential malicious behavior for data exfiltration. The code lacks proper input validation, error handling, and does not request user consent for data collection. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL is highly suspicious and suggests this may be part of a malware distribution mechanism or unauthorized telemetry collection."
