    "analysis": "This code collects comprehensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, usernames, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data through an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. The purpose is clearly to exfiltrate system information to an external party. The code uses multiple Node.js built-in modules for system introspection and network communication, with no apparent sanitization or user consent mechanisms.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for data exfiltration. It collects and sends sensitive system information to a remote Discord webhook without user knowledge or consent.",
