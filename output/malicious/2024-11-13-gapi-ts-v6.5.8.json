    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package metadata including IP addresses, hostname, user info, DNS settings, and package details. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves automated data exfiltration without explicit user consent. The inclusion of both internal and external IP addresses suggests potential reconnaissance capabilities. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates a persistent backdoor mechanism for data collection.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server without user knowledge or consent. It's likely part of a data collection or surveillance module.",
