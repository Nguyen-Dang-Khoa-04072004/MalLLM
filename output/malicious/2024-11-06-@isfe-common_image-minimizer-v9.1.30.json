    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS servers, hostname, user information, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a Discord webhook, potentially allowing unauthorized data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates malicious intent to send collected data to an external server. Additionally, the code lacks proper error handling for network requests and doesn't validate SSL certificates when making HTTPS connections.",
