    "purpose": "This code appears to be a backdoor implementation that connects to a remote server, receives commands, and executes them on the victim's machine. It also has functionality to receive and save files from the server.",
    "sources": [
        "remote server connection (line 20)",
        "commands received from server (line 33)",
        "file paths received from server (line 37)"
    ],
    "sinks": [
        "execution of arbitrary commands via child_process.exec (line 52)",
        "writing to filesystem (line 43, 49)",
        "network communication with remote server (lines 23, 28, 47, 71, 66)"
    ],
    "flows": [
        "server -> client (commands and file transfers)",
        "client -> server (system info, file status, command output)"
    ],
    "anomalies": [
        "use of eval-like behavior through child_process.exec with untrusted input",
        "spawning process with detached flag to run in background",
        "automatic reconnection logic to maintain persistence",
        "file transfer capability allowing potential malware delivery"
    ],
    "analysis": "This code implements a remote access trojan (RAT) that establishes a persistent connection to a remote command and control server. The client can receive and execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, as well as receive and save files. It uses child_process.exec to run commands without proper sanitization of input, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks. The postinstall.js script ensures the backdoor runs automatically after installation by spawning the main script in the background.",
    "conclusion": "High risk security vulnerability - this is clearly malicious backdoor code that allows remote command execution and file transfer capabilities.",
