    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects various system details including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this information to a Discord webhook. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external service. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL suggests this might be part of a tracking or telemetry mechanism. Additionally, the code uses potentially dangerous methods like process.stdout.write() which can be exploited for command injection in certain contexts.",
    "conclusion": "The code poses a significant security risk due to unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to a third-party service. It should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
