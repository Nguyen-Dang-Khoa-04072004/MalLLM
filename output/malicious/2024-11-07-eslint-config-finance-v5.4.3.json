    "analysis": "The code collects comprehensive system and package metadata including internal and external IP addresses, OS information, DNS settings, and package details. It then transmits this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior constitutes a privacy risk as it sends sensitive information to an external party without explicit user consent. The code also contains several anomalies including hardcoded credentials, potential data leakage, and improper handling of data streams.",
