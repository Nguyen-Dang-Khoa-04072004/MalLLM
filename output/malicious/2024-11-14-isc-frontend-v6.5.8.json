    "analysis": "This code is a clear example of telemetry/data collection malware. It gathers extensive system information including IP addresses, DNS configuration, usernames, and package details, then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The use of ipinfo.io to determine external IP address, combined with the systematic collection of OS and network information, suggests malicious intent. There's no legitimate reason for an npm package to send such comprehensive system diagnostics to a third-party service without explicit user consent.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed to collect system information and send it to a remote server. It represents a serious security risk as it can be used for reconnaissance, tracking, or other malicious activities.",
