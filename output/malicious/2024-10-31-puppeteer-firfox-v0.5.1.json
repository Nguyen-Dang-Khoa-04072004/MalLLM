        "Use of obfuscated variable names (_0x95ba4d, _0x33c422, etc.) suggests potential code obfuscation",

        "Hardcoded platform identifiers in switch statement may be vulnerable to manipulation",
        "Potential insecure download URL construction based on OS platform detection"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code implements a platform-specific download URL generator for browser binaries using node.js os module. It uses obfuscated variable names which may indicate attempts to hide malicious behavior or complexity. The getDownloadUrl function takes a base URL and returns different paths based on detected operating system. This pattern can be risky if the platform detection is bypassed or if the URLs are constructed from untrusted input, potentially leading to insecure downloads.",
    "conclusion": "Medium security risk due to obfuscation patterns and potential insecure platform detection. The use of obfuscated variable names raises concerns about code intent and possible malicious activity.",
