    ],
    "analysis": "This code performs several concerning actions: it collects comprehensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user information, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code includes what appears to be obfuscated variable names and makes direct HTTP requests to external services. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or tracking software that silently gathers user information and transmits it without clear disclosure to the user.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for unauthorized data collection and transmission. It exhibits clear signs of telemetry/tracking behavior with hardcoded credentials and aggressive information gathering.",
