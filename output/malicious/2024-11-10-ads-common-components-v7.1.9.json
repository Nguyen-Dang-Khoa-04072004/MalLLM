{
    "purpose": "The code appears to be collecting system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS settings, and package details, then sending this data via HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook endpoint.",
    "analysis": "This code collects comprehensive system information including IP addresses, DNS configuration, package metadata, and user details. It then sends this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This constitutes a serious security risk as it exposes potentially sensitive network and system information to an external service without user consent. The code also retrieves external IP information through an unverified third-party service, which could be exploited for tracking purposes.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to external services without proper authorization or encryption.",
