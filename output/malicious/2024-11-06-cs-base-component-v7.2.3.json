    "analysis": "The code collects comprehensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS settings, OS details, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which could constitute a security risk by exposing sensitive information about the system and environment to an external party. The external IP lookup uses ipinfo.io which may also have privacy implications.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to unauthorized data exfiltration to external service with hardcoded credentials, potential exposure of internal network information, and lack of user consent for data collection.",
