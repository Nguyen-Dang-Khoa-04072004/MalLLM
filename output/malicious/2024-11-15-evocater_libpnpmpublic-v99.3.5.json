    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then transmits this data to hard-coded external domains using unencrypted HTTP requests. The presence of these hardcoded C2 (Command and Control) domains, combined with the transmission of identifying system information, strongly suggests malicious intent. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false disables SSL certificate verification, making the communication vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear characteristics of malware behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to remote servers. It represents a significant security risk.",
