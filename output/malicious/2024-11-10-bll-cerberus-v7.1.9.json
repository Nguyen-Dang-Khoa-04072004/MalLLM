    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS configuration, user details, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The primary security concern is unauthorized data exfiltration as the code does not appear to have any user consent mechanism or encryption for the transmitted data. The hardcoded credentials and endpoint make this particularly dangerous.",
