    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then transmits this information to external domains that appear to be tracking services. The code uses insecure HTTP connections with disabled SSL verification, which could allow man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or data collection functionality often associated with malware or spyware.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates suspicious behavior characteristic of telemetry or data exfiltration. It collects system identifiers and sends them to external domains without proper security measures.",
