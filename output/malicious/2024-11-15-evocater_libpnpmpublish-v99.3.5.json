    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user info. It then sends this data to multiple external domains that appear to be part of security testing infrastructure (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests potential attempts to bypass security checks, which is often seen in malicious code. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves unauthorized data exfiltration to third-party domains.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to external domains without user consent, potentially for surveillance or data exfiltration purposes.",
