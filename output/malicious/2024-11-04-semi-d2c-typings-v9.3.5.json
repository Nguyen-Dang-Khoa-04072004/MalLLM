    "analysis": "The code extracts system information including hostname, username, home directory, and IP address, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to three hardcoded external domains. It uses querystring.stringify to encode the data and makes insecure HTTP requests with rejectUnauthorized set to false, which disables SSL certificate verification. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malware activity or unauthorized data collection.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of malicious activity - likely a form of malware or data exfiltration tool",
