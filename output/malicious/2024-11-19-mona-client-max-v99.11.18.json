    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data to multiple external domains using HTTP GET requests. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' disables SSL certificate verification, which could allow man-in-the-middle attacks. The hardcoded domain names suggest this code may be part of a telemetry or tracking mechanism.",
