    "analysis": "The code performs a series of operations that suggest it's designed to exfiltrate system information to remote servers. It collects various pieces of identifying information about the host machine including hostname, username, home directory, and current working directory. This data is then encoded into a query string and sent via HTTP GET requests to three different domains. The use of fetch and http.request indicates multiple potential communication channels, while the disabled TLS verification suggests an attempt to bypass security checks. The presence of these behaviors in what appears to be a package file raises significant concerns about potential malware activity.",
