    ],
    "analysis": "The code is collecting sensitive system information including hostname, username, home directory, and IP address. It then packages this data into a query string and sends it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains. This behavior is typical of malicious software designed to exfiltrate data from compromised systems. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates an attempt to bypass SSL certificate validation, which is commonly done by malware to avoid detection. Additionally, the presence of hardcoded domain names in a package.json context suggests this might be part of a deceptive npm package.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of malicious activity. This code exhibits characteristics of data exfiltration and potentially malware.",
