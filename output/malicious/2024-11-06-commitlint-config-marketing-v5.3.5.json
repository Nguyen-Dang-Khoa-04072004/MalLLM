    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package that collects system information and sends it to a Discord webhook. It gathers internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package metadata.",
    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS servers, usernames, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a significant privacy and security risk as it transmits potentially sensitive information about the system and user without explicit consent.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The package is designed to collect and transmit sensitive system information to an external service without user consent, which constitutes a serious privacy violation and potential security threat.",
