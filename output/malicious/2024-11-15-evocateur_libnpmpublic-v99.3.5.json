    ],
    "analysis": "This code implements a data collection mechanism that gathers system identifiers (MAC addresses, hostname, user info) and sends them to external tracking servers. The presence of hardcoded domain names in _tmp_2 suggests it's designed to communicate with specific command-and-control servers. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false indicates an attempt to bypass SSL security checks, which is commonly seen in malicious software to avoid detection. The code also uses base64 encoding on sensitive data before transmission, suggesting some level of obfuscation.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious tracking software or spyware that collects system information and exfiltrates it to remote servers without user knowledge or consent.",
