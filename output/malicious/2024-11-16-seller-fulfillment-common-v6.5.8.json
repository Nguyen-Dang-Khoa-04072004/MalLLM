    "analysis": "This code is designed to gather comprehensive system and package information, then transmit it to a remote Discord webhook. The primary concern is that it sends potentially sensitive data including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS configuration, and package metadata to an external server without explicit user consent. This behavior strongly suggests data collection or telemetry functionality that could be malicious if used for unauthorized surveillance or data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits high-risk behavior typical of telemetry or data collection malware. It gathers extensive system information and transmits it to a remote Discord webhook without clear justification or user consent.",
