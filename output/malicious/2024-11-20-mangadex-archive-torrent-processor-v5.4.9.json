    "analysis": "The code performs several concerning actions: it collects comprehensive system information including internal/external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and user details. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL suggests potential malicious intent or unauthorized data exfiltration. Additionally, there's no validation or user consent for sending this information, making it highly suspicious.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external Discord webhook without user consent. It represents a high-security risk due to data exfiltration capabilities.",
