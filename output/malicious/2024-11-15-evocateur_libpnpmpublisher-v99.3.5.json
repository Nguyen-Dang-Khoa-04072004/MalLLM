    "analysis": "This code performs several suspicious activities: 1) It enumerates all network interfaces and collects MAC addresses, 2) It gathers system information like hostname and user info, 3) It constructs tracking data containing this information, 4) It sends this sensitive data to multiple external domains using HTTP requests with disabled SSL verification, 5) The target domains appear to be part of a tracking/c2 infrastructure based on their naming patterns. This behavior is typical of malware or spyware that exfiltrates device information.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to external servers without user consent.",
