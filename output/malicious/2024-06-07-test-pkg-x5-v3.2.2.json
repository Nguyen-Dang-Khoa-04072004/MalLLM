        "Potential integer overflow in arithmetic operations due to lack of bounds checking on large integers",

        "Division by zero not explicitly checked in all cases where division occurs",
        "Missing input validation for parameters in multiple methods"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code defines a Fraction class with extensive functionality for rational number manipulation. Key areas of concern include potential integer overflow during arithmetic operations, especially with large numbers, and missing explicit checks for division by zero in several methods. The implementation uses mathematical algorithms for GCD calculation and prime factorization, which could be vulnerable to performance issues with very large inputs. Several methods perform operations without comprehensive parameter validation.",
    "conclusion": "The code has moderate security risk due to potential integer overflow vulnerabilities and insufficient input validation in arithmetic operations, but no direct injection or execution risks were identified.",
