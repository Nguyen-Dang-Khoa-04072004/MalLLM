    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS settings, user information, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is highly suspicious behavior typically associated with malware or unwanted telemetry. The code uses multiple Node.js built-in modules (os, dns, https) to gather information and performs HTTP requests to exfiltrate data. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits strong characteristics of malware, specifically a data stealer or trojan that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
