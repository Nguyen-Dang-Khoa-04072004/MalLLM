    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a JavaScript SDK that collects system information and sends it to a Discord webhook. It gathers internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package metadata.",
    "analysis": "This code contains significant security risks including hardcoded credentials (Discord webhook URL), unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, lack of encryption for transmitted data, and potential exposure of internal network information. The code automatically collects and sends system details such as IP addresses, hostnames, user information, and package metadata to an external server without explicit user consent.",
    "conclusion": "High risk security vulnerability. This code violates privacy best practices by collecting and transmitting sensitive system information without user consent and uses hard-coded credentials.",
