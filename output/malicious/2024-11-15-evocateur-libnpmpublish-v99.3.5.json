        "Potential data exfiltration to third-party domains"
    ],
    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then encodes this data and sends it to hardcoded external domains via HTTP requests. The presence of domains ending in '.oast.fun' and '.byted-dast.com' suggests this may be communicating with a tracking or monitoring service. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' in the HTTP request configuration indicates potential attempts to bypass SSL certificate validation, which could be a sign of malicious activity.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with data exfiltration and tracking. It collects system identifiers and sends them to external domains, raising significant privacy and security concerns.",
