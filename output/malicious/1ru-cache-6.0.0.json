    "purpose": "The code implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with optional expiration and eviction policies. It manages a bounded set of key-value pairs, removing the least recently used items when the cache exceeds its maximum size or age.",

    "sinks": [],
    "flows": [],
    "anomalies": [],
    "analysis": "The code implements an LRU cache using a combination of a Map for fast key lookups and a Yallist for maintaining access order. It supports configurable maximum size, maximum age for entries, and callbacks for disposal of evicted items. Key operations include setting/getting entries, trimming the cache when limits are exceeded, and handling stale entries based on age. The implementation appears robust with proper validation of inputs and careful management of memory and resource cleanup through disposal hooks.",
    "conclusion": "The code implements a standard LRU cache with additional features like expiration and disposal hooks. No immediate security vulnerabilities are apparent from static analysis alone, though runtime behavior would need further evaluation.",
