    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including IP address, hostname, username, and directory paths. It then sends this data to three hardcoded external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration. The use of http instead of https and disabling SSL verification further compounds the security concerns.",
