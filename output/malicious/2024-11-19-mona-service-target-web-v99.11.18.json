    "analysis": "This code collects various system identifiers including MAC addresses, hostname, and user information. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains that appear to be part of a tracking infrastructure. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false indicates potential man-in-the-middle attack susceptibility. The code also performs base64 encoding on collected MAC addresses, which may be an obfuscation technique for the tracking data.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates behavior consistent with telemetry or tracking software that collects system information and sends it to remote servers. The presence of hardcoded external domains and the collection of sensitive identifiers like MAC addresses makes this code suspicious and potentially malicious.",
