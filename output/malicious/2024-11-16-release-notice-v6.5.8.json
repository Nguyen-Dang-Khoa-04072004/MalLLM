    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system and package information including internal IP, external IP, hostname, DNS servers, user info, and package details. It then sends all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The presence of '___resolved' suggests possible tampering or package modification. The code uses multiple Node.js core modules (os, dns, https) to gather information and transmit it over HTTPS, which is a clear indication of data exfiltration behavior.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed to collect system information and send it to an external server without user consent. It represents a serious security risk and potential privacy violation.",
