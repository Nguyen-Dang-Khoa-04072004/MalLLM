    "analysis": "This code implements a tracking mechanism that gathers extensive system and package metadata, including internal/external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS configuration, and package details. The collected data is then sent via HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This represents a clear case of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, potentially violating privacy and security policies.",
