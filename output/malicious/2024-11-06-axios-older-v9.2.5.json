    "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS servers, hostname, user info, and package details, then send this data to a Discord webhook for tracking purposes.",
    "analysis": "This code collects various system and package information and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook. It retrieves both internal and external IP addresses, system metadata, and package details. This constitutes a significant security risk as it performs unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external service without explicit user consent. The presence of hardcoded credentials and potentially obfuscated code suggests malicious intent or at least poor security practices.",
    "conclusion": "High-risk code for data exfiltration and potential compromise of user privacy and system security.",
    "confidence": 0.95
