        "Use of hardcoded domain names that appear to be part of a tracking or telemetry infrastructure",
        "Sending system identifiers (MAC address, hostname, user info) to external domains over HTTP",
        "Use of `rejectUnauthorized: false` which disables SSL certificate validation",
        "Base64 encoding of sensitive system information before transmission"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then transmits this data to multiple external domains using HTTP requests without proper TLS verification. The presence of hardcoded domain names commonly associated with tracking services and the lack of SSL certificate validation indicate potential telemetry or surveillance functionality. The base64 encoding of the MAC addresses suggests an attempt to obscure the transmitted data.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of telemetry or surveillance software that collects system information and sends it to remote servers. The use of hardcoded domains and disabled SSL verification raises significant security concerns.",
