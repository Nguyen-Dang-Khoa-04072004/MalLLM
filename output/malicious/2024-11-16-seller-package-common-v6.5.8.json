    ],
    "analysis": "The code performs several concerning actions: it gathers comprehensive system information including both internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS servers, and user details. It then sends all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint, which strongly suggests this is telemetry or tracking code. The code uses multiple Node.js modules (os, dns, https) to collect various system attributes and makes outbound HTTPS connections to ipinfo.io for external IP lookup. There's no apparent legitimate reason for such extensive system information collection and transmission to an external service in a common package.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to an external Discord webhook without user consent.",
