    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.",
    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, user details, and package metadata, then transmits this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This represents a significant security risk as it enables unauthorized data exfiltration without explicit user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups and uses OS-specific functions to gather potentially sensitive information about the environment.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk - The code is malicious due to unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to an external service. It violates privacy and security best practices by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it without user knowledge or consent.",
