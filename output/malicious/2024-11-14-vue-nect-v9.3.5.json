    "analysis": "This code performs system fingerprinting by collecting MAC addresses, hostname, and user information. It then sends this sensitive data to known command and control (C2) domains using unverified HTTP requests. The presence of hardcoded malicious domains and disabling of SSL validation indicates potential malicious intent. The code also uses base64 encoding for data transmission, suggesting attempts at obfuscation.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to external C2 servers without user knowledge or consent.",
