    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal IP, external IP, hostname, DNS servers, user info, and package details. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a potential privacy and security risk as it transmits identifying information about the system and potentially the user without explicit consent. The use of hardcoded credentials and sending data to external services without verification constitutes a security concern.",
    "conclusion": "The code poses a significant security risk due to unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external service with hardcoded credentials.",
