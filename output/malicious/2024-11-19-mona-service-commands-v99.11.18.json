    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data to multiple hardcoded external domains using unverified HTTPS requests. The presence of multiple C2 domains and the use of rejectUnauthorized: false indicates potential malicious intent. The code also uses base64 encoding for data transmission which could be an attempt to obfuscate the payload.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates clear signs of malicious behavior including system information gathering and unauthorized data exfiltration to third-party servers.",
