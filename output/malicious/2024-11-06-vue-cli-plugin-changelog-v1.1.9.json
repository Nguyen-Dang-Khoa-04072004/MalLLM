    ],
    "analysis": "The code appears to be a Vue CLI plugin that generates changelogs. It uses Node.js built-in modules like os, dns, querystring, and https. The main security concern is that it exposes system information (hostname and user info) through stdout without sanitization, potentially leading to information disclosure. Additionally, the code writes data directly to stdout which could be problematic if the data contains sensitive information or if the output is not properly handled.",
    "conclusion": "Low to medium security risk due to potential information disclosure through system information exposure and lack of proper data sanitization before writing to stdout.",
