    "analysis": "The code collects network interface MAC addresses, hostname, and user information, then encodes this data and sends it via HTTP GET requests to known tracking domains. The presence of hardcoded domains associated with security testing platforms (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) suggests this may be part of a malicious payload designed for data exfiltration or command and control communication. The disabling of SSL certificate verification (rejectUnauthorized: false) further indicates malicious intent by bypassing security measures.",
    "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its behavior of collecting system information and sending it to external domains, including known tracking services. It exhibits patterns consistent with malware or trojan behavior.",
