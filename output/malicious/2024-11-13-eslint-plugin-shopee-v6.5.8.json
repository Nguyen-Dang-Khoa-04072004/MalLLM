    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of an ESLint plugin for Shopee that collects system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and package details, then sends this data to a Discord webhook for tracking purposes.",
    "analysis": "The code performs several potentially risky operations including collecting system information such as IP addresses, hostnames, and user details, then sending this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook. This represents a clear data exfiltration risk. The use of unvalidated inputs and hardcoded credentials raises serious security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk. The code contains a data exfiltration mechanism that sends system information to an external service without proper consent or security measures.",
