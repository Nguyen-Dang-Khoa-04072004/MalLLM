    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to known malicious domains. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests an attempt to bypass SSL security checks, which could indicate malicious intent. This behavior is consistent with tracking or telemetry software that sends device information to remote servers.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity by collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains without proper authorization or encryption.",
