This data is then formatted and sent via HTTP GET requests to three different external domains. These domains appear to be part of a tracking infrastructure (oast.fun, oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com). The code uses insecure HTTP connections with rejectUnauthorized disabled, which could allow man-in-the-middle attacks. The purpose seems to be tracking package usage behavior without explicit user consent.",
