    "purpose": "The code appears to be making an HTTPS request to a remote server with IP address 52.15.44.253 and streaming the response data to stdout. It also collects system information using OS module functions.",

    "analysis": "The code makes a network request to a hardcoded IP address (52.15.44.253) which could indicate malicious activity. System information (hostname, user info) is collected and potentially sent to the remote server. The response data is directly written to stdout, which could be used for data exfiltration or command execution. The use of querystring module is outdated and may introduce vulnerabilities.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious behavior including potential data exfiltration and hardcoded IP addresses. It should be considered high risk.",
