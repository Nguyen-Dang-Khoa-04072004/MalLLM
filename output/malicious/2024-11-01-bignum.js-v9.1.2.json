    "purpose": "The code appears to be a JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic (bignumber.js) with some obfuscated code that seems to contain malware-related functionality including platform detection, file operations, and network requests.",

    ],
    "analysis": "This code combines legitimate big number arithmetic library with malicious obfuscated code. The primary purpose appears to be cryptocurrency mining malware that detects the operating system, downloads appropriate binary executables, and runs them. The obfuscation makes static analysis difficult, but patterns clearly indicate malicious intent including network communication, file manipulation, and process execution.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code disguised as a legitimate JavaScript library. It contains functionality to download and execute platform-specific binaries for cryptocurrency mining purposes.",
