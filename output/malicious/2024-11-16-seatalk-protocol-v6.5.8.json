{
    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata, then send this data via HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook.",
    "analysis": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting comprehensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, usernames, and package metadata, then exfiltrating it to a remote Discord webhook. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates this is likely part of a botnet or surveillance tool. The code performs both internal IP enumeration and external IP lookup via ipinfo.io, suggesting it's designed to gather network topology information. No obfuscation is apparent, and the code structure is straightforward, indicating it's intentionally readable for its malicious purpose. The lack of user consent or opt-in mechanism makes this highly suspicious from a security standpoint."
