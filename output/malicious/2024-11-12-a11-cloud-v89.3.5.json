It then encodes this data and sends it via HTTP GET requests to hardcoded external domains. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' disables SSL certificate validation, which could allow man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of telemetry or tracking functionality.",
