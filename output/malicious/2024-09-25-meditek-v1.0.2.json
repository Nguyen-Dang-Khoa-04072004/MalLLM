    "analysis": "The code collects various system information such as operating system type, architecture, hostname, and user information. It then sends this data through an HTTPS request, which suggests potential data exfiltration. The use of process.stdout.write() instead of console.log() is suspicious and may indicate attempts to hide output from standard logging mechanisms. This pattern is commonly associated with malware behavior.",
