    "analysis": "This code collects comprehensive system information including IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and package details, then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the transmission of potentially sensitive system information without explicit user consent indicates malicious behavior. The code also uses undocumented features of package.json which may indicate tampering or obfuscation.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration to an external service via a Discord webhook. It collects and transmits sensitive system information without user knowledge or consent.",
