    ],
    "analysis": "This code demonstrates clear data exfiltration behavior by collecting comprehensive system information and sending it to a remote Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates this is likely malicious code designed to report system details to an attacker's server. The collection includes internal IP addresses, external IP addresses, hostnames, user information, DNS servers, and package metadata - all of which can be used for reconnaissance purposes. The use of multiple network calls and system APIs suggests it's designed to gather maximum information about the compromised environment.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for data exfiltration. It collects extensive system information and sends it to a remote Discord webhook, indicating potential compromise or intentional backdoor functionality.",
