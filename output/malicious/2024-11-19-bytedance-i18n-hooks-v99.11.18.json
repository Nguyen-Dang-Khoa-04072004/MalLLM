    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then constructs tracking data and sends it via HTTP GET requests to predetermined external domains. The presence of hardcoded domains ending in '.oast.fun' or '.byted-dast.com' suggests potential malicious activity related to security testing or data exfiltration. Additionally, disabling SSL certificate verification ('rejectUnauthorized: false') raises security concerns as it makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains without clear legitimate purpose. The hardcoded domains and disabled SSL verification indicate possible intent to exfiltrate data or conduct security testing.",
