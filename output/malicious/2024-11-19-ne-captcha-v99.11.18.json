    "analysis": "This code collects hardware identifiers (MAC addresses), system metadata (hostname, username), and sends it to multiple external domains that appear to be tracking or command-and-control servers. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt at obfuscation. The hardcoded domains and lack of authentication/authorization make this highly suspicious behavior. The 'rejectUnauthorized: false' flag indicates potential man-in-the-middle attack mitigation bypass.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to external tracking domains without explicit user consent, likely for surveillance or data collection purposes.",
