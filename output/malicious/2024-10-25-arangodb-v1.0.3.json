        "Potential command injection vulnerability due to direct execution of user-provided commands",
        "No input validation or sanitization for received commands"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code implements a TCP client that connects to a remote server and waits for commands to execute. When it receives data from the server, it directly passes that data to child_process.exec() without any validation or sanitization. This creates a critical security vulnerability where an attacker could send malicious commands that would be executed on the system with the privileges of the running process. The code also lacks any form of authentication or authorization checks.",
    "conclusion": "Critical security vulnerability detected: Command Injection. The application directly executes user-provided commands without validation, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
