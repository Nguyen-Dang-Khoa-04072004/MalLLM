    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this information to external domains through HTTP GET requests. The presence of hardcoded domain names suggests tracking or telemetry functionality. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false indicates potential security risks by disabling SSL validation. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious software that harvests system information for tracking purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious telemetry or tracking software that collects system information and sends it to remote servers. It poses significant privacy and security risks.",
