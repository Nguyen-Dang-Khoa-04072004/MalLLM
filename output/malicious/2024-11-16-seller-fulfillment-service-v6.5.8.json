    "analysis": "This code is highly suspicious as it performs extensive system reconnaissance and sends sensitive data to an external Discord webhook. It collects internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS configuration, and package metadata. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and the lack of any user consent mechanism strongly indicates malicious behavior designed for data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code that gathers system information and exfiltrates it to a remote Discord webhook, violating user privacy and potentially enabling further attacks.",
