    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, OS details, package metadata, and user information. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or data exfiltration functionality. The presence of multiple data collection points (network interfaces, DNS servers, OS info) combined with sending to an external service makes this code suspicious and potentially malicious from a security standpoint.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates clear telemetry/exfiltration behavior that collects and sends sensitive system information to an external Discord webhook. The hardcoded webhook URL and comprehensive data collection make this a high-risk security concern.",
