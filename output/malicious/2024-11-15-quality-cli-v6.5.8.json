    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal/external IP addresses, DNS servers, hostname, user info, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a clear case of unauthorized data exfiltration and telemetry collection without explicit user consent. The use of external services to gather system information is typical of tracking/malware behavior.",
