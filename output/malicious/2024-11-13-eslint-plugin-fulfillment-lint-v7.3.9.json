{
    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Node.js package that collects system information including internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package metadata, then sends this data to a Discord webhook for tracking purposes.",
    "analysis": "The code performs extensive system information gathering and transmits it via HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. It collects both internal and external IP addresses, system metadata, and package information. The primary concern is the transmission of potentially sensitive information to an external service without explicit user consent or configuration options. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates this is likely part of a telemetry or analytics system that may be collecting data without clear opt-in mechanisms."
