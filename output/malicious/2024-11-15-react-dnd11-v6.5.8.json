    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, and package metadata, then transmits it to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or data exfiltration functionality, where the application is designed to report system details back to an external server without user consent. The presence of multiple data sources and sinks confirms the potential for unauthorized data transmission.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external webhook, violating privacy and security best practices.",
