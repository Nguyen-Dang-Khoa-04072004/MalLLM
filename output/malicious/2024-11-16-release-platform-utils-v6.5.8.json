    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and package details, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.",
    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, DNS settings, and package metadata, then sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The primary concern is the unauthorized transmission of sensitive system information to an external service without explicit user consent. The code makes two HTTP requests - one to fetch external IP via ipinfo.io and another to send data to Discord. There's minimal error handling which could lead to unhandled exceptions. The hardcoded webhook URL suggests this might be part of a monitoring or telemetry system that could be used for malicious purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This code poses a significant privacy and security risk by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server without user knowledge or consent. It represents a clear violation of user privacy and could be used for tracking or malicious activities.",
    "confidence": 0.95
