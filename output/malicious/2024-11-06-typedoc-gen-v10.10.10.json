    "analysis": "The code reads system information using os module functions and makes an HTTPS request to fetch data. It then writes the received data to stdout. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities like injection flaws or unsafe data handling, but the code could benefit from more robust error handling and modern JavaScript practices.",
    "conclusion": "Low to moderate security risk. The code performs basic system introspection and network operations without apparent malicious intent, though it lacks proper error handling.",
