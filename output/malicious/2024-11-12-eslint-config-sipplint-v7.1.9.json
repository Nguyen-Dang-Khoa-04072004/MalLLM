    "purpose": "The code appears to be collecting system information and sending it to a Discord webhook. It retrieves internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package metadata.",
    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including IP addresses, hostname, user info, DNS servers, and package metadata. This data is then formatted into JSON and sent to a Discord webhook. The primary concern is the hardcoded webhook URL which could be abused if compromised. Additionally, the script sends potentially sensitive information about the system environment to an external service without any encryption or authentication.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a telemetry script that collects system information and sends it to a remote Discord webhook. It poses a security risk due to the hardcoded credentials and potential exposure of sensitive system information.",
