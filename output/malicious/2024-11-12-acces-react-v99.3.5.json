    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains. These domains appear to be part of a tracking infrastructure. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate the transmitted data. Disabling SSL certificate verification makes the communication vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior is typical of malicious software or tracking scripts.",
