    ],
    "analysis": "This code performs extensive system information gathering including internal/external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user details, and package metadata. It then sends all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint, suggesting potential data exfiltration or telemetry collection. The code also makes an HTTPS GET request to ipinfo.io to fetch external IP information and uses an HTTPS POST request to send data to Discord. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity designed to collect system information without user consent.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed to collect sensitive system information and transmit it to a remote Discord webhook, violating privacy and potentially enabling unauthorized surveillance.",
