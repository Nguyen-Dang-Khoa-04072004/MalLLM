    "analysis": "The code gathers extensive system and package metadata including internal/external IP addresses, DNS servers, usernames, hostnames, and package details. It then transmits this data via HTTPS to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This represents a significant privacy and security risk as it automatically collects and exfiltrates potentially sensitive user information without explicit consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates malicious intent to send data to a specific third-party service.",
