    "analysis": "The code contains several security-sensitive elements. It uses eval() on a decoded base64 string which could lead to arbitrary code execution. Environment variable handling includes functions that clear environment variables after reading them, suggesting potential misuse. Shell command execution through console.shell.sync poses risks if inputs are not properly sanitized. The code also uses console.jsonFromFile which may be vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the file path is not properly validated.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of code injection and insecure deserialization vulnerabilities due to eval() usage and improper environment variable handling.",
