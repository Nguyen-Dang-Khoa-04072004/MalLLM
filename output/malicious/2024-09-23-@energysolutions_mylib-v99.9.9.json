    "analysis": "This is a clear case of malware behavior. The script collects sensitive system information including OS details, CPU info, hostname, and IP address. It then encrypts this data and sends it to a Discord webhook, which is a common technique used by malware to exfiltrate data from compromised systems. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and the use of encryption suggests this is not a benign utility but rather a malicious payload.",
    "conclusion": "High risk - This is malicious code designed to steal system information and send it to an external server.",
