    ],
    "analysis": "This code demonstrates a pattern commonly associated with telemetry or data exfiltration. It gathers hardware and system identifiers (MAC addresses, hostname, user info) and transmits them to hardcoded external domains. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt at obfuscation. The 'rejectUnauthorized: false' setting indicates potential insecurity in communication. The hardcoded domains point to external tracking services which could be used for monitoring or analytics purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This code has significant security implications as it performs unauthorized data collection and transmission to external services. It exhibits characteristics of telemetry code that may be used for monitoring or tracking user activity.",
