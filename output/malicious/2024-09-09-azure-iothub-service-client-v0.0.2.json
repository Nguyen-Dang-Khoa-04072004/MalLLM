It performs several suspicious activities including reading local files, executing system commands to gather network information, and exfiltrating collected data to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The presence of hardcoded credentials (webhook URL) and the collection of sensitive system information indicates this is likely part of a botnet or reconnaissance tool.",
