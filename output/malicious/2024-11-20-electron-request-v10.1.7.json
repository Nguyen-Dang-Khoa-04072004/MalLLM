    "analysis": "The code collects various system and network information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user information, and package metadata. This data is then formatted as JSON and sent to a Discord webhook endpoint. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the comprehensive nature of the collected data suggests this is likely a tracking or telemetry module that sends information about the system to an external server.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a potential security risk due to unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external service. It appears to be designed for tracking purposes rather than legitimate functionality.",
