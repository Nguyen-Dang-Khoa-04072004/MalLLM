    "analysis": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting comprehensive system and network information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, indicating potential data exfiltration. The collection of both internal and external IP addresses, along with DNS servers and OS information, suggests surveillance capabilities. The use of HTTPS for communication and data serialization makes it more sophisticated but still clearly malicious in intent.",
    "conclusion": "This code is malicious software that collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote Discord server, posing significant privacy and security risks.",
