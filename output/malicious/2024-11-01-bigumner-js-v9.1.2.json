    "purpose": "The code appears to be a JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, specifically the BigNumber.js library. It provides functions for handling very large numbers with high precision.",

    "anomalies": [
        "The first file contains obfuscated code with encoded strings that appear to be related to error messages and platform-specific paths",
        "The second file shows standard BigNumber.js implementation with extensive mathematical operations"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code consists of two files. The first file contains obfuscated JavaScript with encoded strings related to error handling and platform detection (darwin, win32). This appears to be part of a larger package that handles cross-platform operations. The second file is the complete BigNumber.js library source code implementing arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic. The library handles various mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and formatting while maintaining precision beyond JavaScript's native number limitations.",
    "conclusion": "This is a legitimate implementation of the BigNumber.js library used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic in JavaScript applications.",
