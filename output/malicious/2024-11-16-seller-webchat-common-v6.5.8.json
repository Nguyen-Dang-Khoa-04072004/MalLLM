    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and package metadata, then sends it to a Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and sending of sensitive system information raises significant security concerns. The code makes HTTP requests to external services which could indicate data exfiltration or monitoring capabilities.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external service without explicit user consent. It represents a high-security risk as it can potentially be used for surveillance or data theft.",
