{
    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata, then sends this data via HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook.",
    "analysis": "This code is designed to gather comprehensive system and package metadata including internal/external IP addresses, hostname, user information, DNS settings, and package details. It then transmits this data to a Discord webhook endpoint using HTTPS requests. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and the collection of potentially sensitive information such as internal IP addresses, hostnames, and user credentials strongly suggests malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, acting as a data stealer that collects system information and sends it to an external Discord webhook. It poses a significant security risk due to unauthorized data transmission.",
