    "analysis": "This code performs extensive system information gathering including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, and package metadata. The collected data is then sent via HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which indicates potential unauthorized data exfiltration. This behavior is typically associated with malicious software or tracking mechanisms rather than legitimate functionality.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates high-risk behavior by collecting sensitive system information and sending it to an external service without clear user consent. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL strongly suggests this code is designed for data exfiltration or tracking purposes.",
