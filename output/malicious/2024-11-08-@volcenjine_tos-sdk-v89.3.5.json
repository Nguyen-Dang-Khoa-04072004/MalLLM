    "analysis": "The code performs several malicious activities including collecting system metadata (hostname, username, home directory, IP address) and sending this data to external domains for tracking. It uses hardcoded domains that appear to be part of a tracking infrastructure. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false indicates potential attempts to bypass security checks. Additionally, the code generates random numbers to obfuscate tracking data, which may be an attempt to evade detection.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software by collecting system information and transmitting it to external servers without user consent. The behavior aligns with data tracking or telemetry mechanisms often found in malware.",
