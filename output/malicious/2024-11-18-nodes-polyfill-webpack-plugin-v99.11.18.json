    ],
    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and potentially user details. It then transmits this information to predetermined external domains via unauthenticated HTTP requests. The presence of hardcoded C2 (Command and Control) domain names suggests this is likely malicious code designed to exfiltrate system information. The use of base64 encoding and 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates attempts to obscure the data transfer and bypass SSL verification.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software that collects system information and sends it to remote servers. It poses a significant security risk by potentially compromising system privacy and enabling remote surveillance.",
