    ],
    "analysis": "This code performs several suspicious activities. It collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. The data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior is typical of tracking/malware code that exfiltrates information from compromised systems. The code makes HTTP requests to external services (ipinfo.io) to gather external IP information, and then sends all collected data to a Discord webhook, which could be used for command and control or data theft.",
    "conclusion": "This is highly suspicious code that likely represents malware or tracking software designed to exfiltrate system information to a remote server. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and comprehensive data collection makes it a clear security risk.",
