{
    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a malicious npm package that collects system information and sends it to a Discord webhook. It gathers internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package metadata.",
    "analysis": "This code demonstrates a clear case of telemetry collection by a malicious npm package. It gathers comprehensive system information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, DNS servers, and package metadata. The data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. The package also attempts to resolve external IP information using an external service (ipinfo.io). This behavior is typical of malware or spyware packages distributed through npm.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: HIGH. This is clearly malicious code designed to collect and exfiltrate system information to a remote server. The hardcoded Discord webhook URL confirms intentional data exfiltration. The package should be immediately removed and flagged as malicious.",
