    "analysis": "This code performs system fingerprinting by collecting MAC addresses, hostname, and user info. It then establishes outbound HTTP connections to known command-and-control domains. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false indicates potential TLS bypass, and the hardcoded domains suggest malicious behavior typical of tracking or surveillance software.",
