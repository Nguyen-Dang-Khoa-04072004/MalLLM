    "analysis": "The script collects various system details such as internal IP, external IP, hostname, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends this potentially sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL using HTTPS. This behavior raises significant privacy and security concerns since it gathers detailed user environment information without explicit consent.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk Detected - The code is sending system information to an external server without user consent, which constitutes a privacy risk and potential security vulnerability due to hardcoded credentials and data exfiltration.",
