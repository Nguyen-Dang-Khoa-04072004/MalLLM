    "analysis": "This code demonstrates a clear data collection and exfiltration pattern. It gathers comprehensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user credentials, DNS configuration, and package metadata. The data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, suggesting malicious intent for surveillance or tracking. The presence of multiple sources and sinks indicates this is designed to collect and transmit sensitive information without transparency.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a security risk with high probability of being malicious. It performs unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external service.",
