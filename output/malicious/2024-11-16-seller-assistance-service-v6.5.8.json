    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including IP addresses (both internal and external), hostname, user info, DNS settings, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or tracking functionality, potentially exfiltrating user data without explicit consent. The use of '___resolved' in package.json suggests obfuscation of the actual tracking mechanism.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for data exfiltration. It collects sensitive system information and sends it to a remote Discord webhook without user consent.",
