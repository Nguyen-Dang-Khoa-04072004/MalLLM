It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which could indicate malicious activity such as data exfiltration or unauthorized tracking. The presence of multiple sources and sinks related to network and system information combined with an external HTTP request makes this highly suspicious.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software due to its data collection and transmission behavior without explicit user consent.",
