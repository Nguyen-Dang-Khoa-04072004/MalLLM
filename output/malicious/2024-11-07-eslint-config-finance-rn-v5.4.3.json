        "Potential exposure of sensitive system information via stdout",
        "No error handling for network requests or parsing failures"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects system and network information including IP addresses, hostname, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a potential privacy and security risk due to the transmission of potentially sensitive system data. Additionally, the code uses unvalidated data from package.json which could be exploited if maliciously modified. The lack of error handling for network operations or JSON parsing presents further risks.",
    "conclusion": "The code contains a security vulnerability due to hardcoding a webhook URL and transmitting system information without proper validation or encryption. It may also expose sensitive data about the system to an external service.",
