    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to known tracking/monitoring domains. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests potential man-in-the-middle attack capabilities. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or data exfiltration functionality commonly found in malicious software.",
