{
    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and send it to a Discord webhook. It retrieves internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package information.",
    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system and package information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS servers, usernames, and package metadata. This data is then sent via HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This represents a significant privacy risk as it transmits potentially sensitive system information without user consent. Additionally, there's no input validation or error handling for the external IP lookup, and the webhook URL is hardcoded directly in the source code.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting sensitive system information to an external server without explicit user consent. This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and privacy violation.",
    "confidence": 1.0
