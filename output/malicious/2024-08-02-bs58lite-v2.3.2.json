    "analysis": "The code reads files recursively and scans for patterns that match private keys (Base58 encoded) or mnemonic phrases. It then attempts to send these findings to an external server via HTTP POST. This behavior suggests potential key harvesting or monitoring capabilities. The use of hardcoded URLs and lack of validation on data sent to external endpoints raises security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "This code has high potential for malicious activity as it scans for cryptographic keys and sends them to external servers. It appears to be designed for surveillance or theft of cryptocurrency assets.",
