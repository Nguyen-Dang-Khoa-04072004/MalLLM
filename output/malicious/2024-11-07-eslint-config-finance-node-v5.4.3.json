    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which constitutes a serious privacy and security risk. The code lacks any form of user consent mechanism or data minimization practices. Additionally, it uses potentially unsafe patterns such as directly parsing JSON from HTTP responses without error handling and sending raw system data without encryption.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information to a third-party service.",
