    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Puppeteer stealth plugin designed to evade detection by anti-bot systems. It manages a list of browser properties and methods to be mocked or modified to avoid identification as automated browser activity.",

        "Obfuscated code detected in wyy7tpho.cjs file with encoded strings and function names",
        "Use of 'navigator.webdriver' in the list of properties to be modified"
    ],
    "analysis": "The primary file (index.js) sets up a stealth plugin for Puppeteer by defining which browser APIs should be modified to prevent detection. The secondary file (wyy7tpho.cjs) contains obfuscated JavaScript with what appears to be cryptocurrency-related strings and error messages, suggesting potential malicious intent.",
    "conclusion": "The code has medium security risk due to its purpose of evading browser detection, but the obfuscated file raises serious concerns about possible malware functionality.",
