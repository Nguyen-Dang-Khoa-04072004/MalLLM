    ],
    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details, then transmits this data to external servers. The presence of hardcoded domain names that are commonly used in security testing and monitoring tools suggests potential tracking or surveillance functionality. The disabling of SSL certificate verification indicates an attempt to bypass security measures, which is often associated with malicious behavior. The code also uses base64 encoding on collected data, possibly to obscure the transmitted information.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of potentially malicious software designed for data collection and exfiltration. It gathers system identifiers and sends them to external domains without clear user consent.",
