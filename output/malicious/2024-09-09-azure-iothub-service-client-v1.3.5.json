    "analysis": "This code demonstrates a clear case of information disclosure through a Discord webhook. It gathers sensitive data including package name, system details, and IP addresses, then exfiltrates this information to a remote server. The presence of hardcoded credentials (webhook URL) and system command execution makes this particularly dangerous as it could enable unauthorized access or data theft.",
    "conclusion": "High risk security vulnerability detected. The code is designed to exfiltrate system information to a remote Discord webhook, constituting a serious security threat.",
