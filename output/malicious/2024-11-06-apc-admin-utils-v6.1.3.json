    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this data via HTTPS to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This constitutes a potential privacy risk as it transmits sensitive system information to an external service without explicit user consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates this behavior is embedded in the code itself rather than configurable by users.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external service without user consent.",
