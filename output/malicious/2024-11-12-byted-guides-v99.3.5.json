    "analysis": "The code collects device-specific identifiers such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user information. These are then encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to predetermined external domains. The presence of hardcoded domains associated with tracking services and the use of insecure HTTP communications raises significant security concerns. The disabling of SSL certificate verification increases vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
