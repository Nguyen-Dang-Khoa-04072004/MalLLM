    "analysis": "The code collects various system details including internal and external IP addresses, DNS servers, hostname, user info, and package metadata. It then sends this information to a Discord webhook using HTTPS POST requests. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the transmission of potentially sensitive system information raises serious security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a clear case of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. It gathers comprehensive system information and sends it to an external server without explicit user consent.",
