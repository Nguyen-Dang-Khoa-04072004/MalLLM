        "Redundant code block with duplicate process.stdout.write(d) on lines 36-37"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code makes an HTTPS request to fetch data and writes it to stdout. It accesses system information via os.hostname() and os.userInfo(), which could potentially expose sensitive information. The redundant code block with duplicated write operations suggests a possible copy-paste error or incomplete code cleanup.",
    "conclusion": "The code has potential information disclosure risks due to system information exposure and contains redundant code that may indicate incomplete implementation or debugging artifacts.",
