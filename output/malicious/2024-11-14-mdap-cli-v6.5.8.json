    "analysis": "This code is highly suspicious as it collects extensive system information and transmits it to an external Discord webhook without clear disclosure. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, collection of potentially sensitive information (IP addresses, hostname, user details), and transmission to an external service are all red flags. The obfuscated variable name '___resolved' also raises suspicion. This behavior is consistent with telemetry or tracking software that may be malicious.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious telemetry/tracking software. It collects personal/system information and sends it to an external service via HTTPS requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
