    "anomalies": [
        "The code uses an external API call to fetch public IP information without any validation or sanitization of input/output.",

    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects various system details including IP addresses, DNS servers, OS information, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior is indicative of telemetry or tracking functionality, which could pose a privacy risk by transmitting user environment data to an external server.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external webhook without explicit user consent. This represents a security risk due to unauthorized data transmission.",
