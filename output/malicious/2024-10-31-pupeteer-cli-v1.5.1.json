    "anomalies": [
        "Use of eval-like behavior with dynamic code execution via yargs command builder",
        "Potential insecure handling of user-provided URLs leading to RCE",
        "Suspicious obfuscated code in kyz1lboy.cjs file with crypto-related strings",
        "Direct system calls without proper validation could lead to arbitrary code execution",
        "No input sanitization for URL parameters before passing to puppeteer"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code uses Puppeteer to navigate to URLs or load local files, which poses a significant security risk if user inputs are not properly sanitized. The tool accepts arbitrary URLs from command-line arguments and passes them directly to page.goto(), which can lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) or remote code execution if malicious content is loaded. Additionally, the presence of obfuscated JavaScript code with crypto-related strings suggests potential malware or backdoor functionality.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to lack of input validation, potential SSRF/RCE vulnerabilities through direct URL handling, and suspicious obfuscated code that may indicate malicious intent.",
