    "analysis": "The code collects various system and network information such as internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user information, and package details. This data is then formatted into JSON and sent to a Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates potential malicious activity or unauthorized data exfiltration. The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization, which could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.",
    "conclusion": "This code poses a significant security risk due to its unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to an external service.",
