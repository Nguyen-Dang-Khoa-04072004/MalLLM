    "analysis": "This code collects device identifiers (MAC addresses), hostname, and user information, then transmits this data to known tracking domains. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate the transmitted data, while the 'rejectUnauthorized: false' flag indicates potential malicious intent by bypassing SSL security. The presence of hardcoded C2 domains confirms this is likely a telemetry or data exfiltration module.",
    "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It collects sensitive system information and sends it to external domains, likely for tracking or data exfiltration purposes.",
