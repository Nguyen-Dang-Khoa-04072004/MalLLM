    ],
    "analysis": "The code constructs PowerShell commands by concatenating user-supplied URLs and file paths into shell commands. This creates a high risk of command injection if the inputs are not properly sanitized. The script downloads a file from a remote source and immediately attempts to execute it, which is a common technique used by malware for execution. The use of 'powershell -Command' with dynamic content is particularly dangerous.",
    "conclusion": "Critical security vulnerability detected. The code is highly susceptible to command injection attacks and represents a serious security risk due to the execution of arbitrary downloaded code.",
