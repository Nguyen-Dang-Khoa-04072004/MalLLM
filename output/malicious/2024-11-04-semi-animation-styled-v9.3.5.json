        "External domains ending in '.oast.fun' which are commonly used for security testing and potential exploitation"
    ],
    "analysis": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software. It collects sensitive system information including IP address, hostname, username, and directory paths, then sends this data to external servers using HTTP requests. The use of obfuscated domain names (ending in .oast.fun) and random number generation in URLs suggests attempts to evade detection. The code also disables SSL certificate verification, which could allow man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration or covert communication patterns often seen in malware.",
    "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior related to data collection and exfiltration. It should be considered a security risk and removed from any environment.",
