It then attempts to send this data to known command and control (C2) servers using HTTP GET requests. The presence of hardcoded domain names associated with security testing services (oast.fun, byted-dast.com) combined with the data exfiltration pattern strongly suggests this code is designed for data theft or remote access purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code that steals system information and sends it to external servers, indicating potential malware behavior.",
