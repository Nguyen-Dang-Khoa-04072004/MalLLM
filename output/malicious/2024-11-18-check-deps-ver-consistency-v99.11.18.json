    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details, then transmits this data to known malicious domains. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate the transmitted data. The HTTP requests disable SSL certificate validation, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior is consistent with malware or data exfiltration scripts.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear characteristics of malicious activity with high probability of being malware. It gathers system identifiers and sends them to suspicious domains, demonstrating typical data exfiltration patterns.",
