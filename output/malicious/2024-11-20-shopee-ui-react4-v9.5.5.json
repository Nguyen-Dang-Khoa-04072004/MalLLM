    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.",
    "analysis": "This code is highly suspicious as it collects comprehensive system information and sends it to an external Discord webhook. It gathers internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, DNS servers, and package metadata. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL indicates potential data exfiltration. This behavior is typical of malicious software or spyware that harvests system information for unauthorized purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration by sending system information to an external Discord webhook without user consent.",
