    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data to external domains that appear to be part of a tracking or monitoring service (indicated by .oast domains). The use of rejectUnauthorized: false suggests an attempt to bypass security checks, and the hardcoded domains are commonly associated with security testing services but could also indicate malicious intent. This behavior is consistent with telemetry or surveillance code.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics of telemetry/malware-like behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains without clear user consent.",
