    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then encodes this data and sends it to hardcoded external domains via HTTP GET requests. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests potential attempts to bypass SSL certificate validation, which is often associated with malicious behavior. This pattern is commonly seen in telemetry or data exfiltration scripts.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious telemetry or data exfiltration behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to remote servers without user consent.",
