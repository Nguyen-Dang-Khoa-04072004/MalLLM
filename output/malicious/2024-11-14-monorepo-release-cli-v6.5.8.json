    ],
    "analysis": "This code demonstrates a clear data exfiltration pattern where system information is collected and transmitted to a third-party Discord webhook. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates this is likely part of a tracking or monitoring system. The code collects potentially sensitive information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS server configurations, and user details. This represents a significant privacy and security risk as it sends detailed system information to an external service without explicit user consent.",
    "conclusion": "This code is malicious due to its unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to an external service. It violates privacy principles by gathering sensitive data including IP addresses, hostnames, and user information without disclosure or consent.",
