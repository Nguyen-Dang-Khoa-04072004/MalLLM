    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata, then sends this data via HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook.",
    "analysis": "This code performs network reconnaissance by collecting various system identifiers such as internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user information, and package metadata. It then transmits this comprehensive set of identifying information to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. This behavior is highly indicative of telemetry or data collection functionality, possibly malicious in nature, as it sends detailed system information over the internet without explicit user consent. The code uses multiple Node.js built-in modules (os, dns, https) to gather information and makes outbound network requests that could be used for surveillance or command and control purposes."
