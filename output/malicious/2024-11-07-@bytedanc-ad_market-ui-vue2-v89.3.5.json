    "analysis": "This code collects various system details including hostname, username, IP address, and directory information, then sends this data to multiple external domains via HTTP GET requests. The data includes potentially sensitive information such as the user's home directory, system hostname, and username. The communication is unencrypted (HTTP) and uses 'rejectUnauthorized: false', which disables SSL certificate validation. This constitutes a clear case of unauthorized data exfiltration and potential privacy violation.",
