    "analysis": "This code performs extensive system information gathering including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL which suggests this code may be used for telemetry, monitoring, or unauthorized data collection. The presence of multiple data sources and sinks, combined with hardcoded credentials and external communication, indicates potentially malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information.",
    "conclusion": "Highly suspicious code that appears to be sending system information to an external Discord webhook, indicating possible data exfiltration or surveillance activity.",
