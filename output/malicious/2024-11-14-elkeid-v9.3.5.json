    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses and hostname, and sends it to hardcoded external domains. The presence of multiple domains with patterns suggesting tracking or command-and-control functionality, combined with disabling SSL certificate verification, indicates potential malicious behavior. The code also uses base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before sending them, which could be an obfuscation technique.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics of potentially malicious software that collects system information and exfiltrates it to remote servers without proper security measures.",
