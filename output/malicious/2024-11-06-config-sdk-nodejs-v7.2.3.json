    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system and package information including internal IP, external IP, hostname, DNS settings, and user details, then sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a clear violation of user privacy and security best practices by transmitting sensitive data without explicit consent. The use of external services for tracking without user knowledge constitutes a security risk.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to unauthorized data collection and transmission to third-party service. Violates privacy principles and potentially exposes system information to malicious actors.",
