        "Use of obfuscated variable names (_0x362c95, _0x12ce6b, etc.) suggests potential code obfuscation or minification.",
        "Direct use of 'os.platform()' without proper validation could lead to unexpected behavior on unsupported platforms."
    ],
    "analysis": "The code includes asynchronous stack hook installation for API classes, which is typically used for debugging. It also contains a function for determining download URLs based on the operating system. The obfuscated variables indicate possible minification or obfuscation techniques, which may obscure malicious behavior.",
    "conclusion": "No direct security vulnerabilities detected, but the obfuscation raises concerns about potential hidden functionality.",
