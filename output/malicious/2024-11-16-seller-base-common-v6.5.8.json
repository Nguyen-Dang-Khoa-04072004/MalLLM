    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, DNS configuration, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is highly suspicious as it constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation or encryption of the transmitted data, making it a clear security risk.",
    "conclusion": "This code is malicious and represents a data exfiltration tool that sends system information to an external Discord webhook. It poses a significant security risk by exposing internal network details and user information.",
