It then transmits this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common technique used in malware for data exfiltration. The code does not perform any legitimate function but rather serves as a covert tracking mechanism.",
    "conclusion": "The code is malicious and exhibits characteristics of a data stealer or surveillance tool designed to gather system information and transmit it to an external server.",
