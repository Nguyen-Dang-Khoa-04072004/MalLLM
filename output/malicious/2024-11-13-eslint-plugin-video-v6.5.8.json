    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal IP, external IP, hostname, user info, DNS servers, and package metadata. This data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The primary concern is that this constitutes unauthorized telemetry/data collection without explicit user consent. The use of external APIs for IP detection and sending data to Discord presents potential privacy and security risks.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external service without clear disclosure or user consent. It represents a security risk due to unauthorized data transmission and contains a hardcoded credential (Discord webhook URL).",
