    ],
    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user information, and package metadata. It then sends this data via HTTPS to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. The presence of the Discord webhook URL, combined with the comprehensive data collection, strongly suggests this is telemetry or tracking code. The use of obfuscated variable names and the inclusion of system information without explicit user consent raises significant privacy and security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for telemetry and data exfiltration. It collects sensitive system information and sends it to an external Discord webhook without user consent.",
