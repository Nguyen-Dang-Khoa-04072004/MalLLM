    "analysis": "The code uses Node.js built-in modules to gather system information (hostname, user info) and makes an HTTPS request. The response data is directly written to stdout, which could expose sensitive system information. There's no validation of the HTTPS request parameters or sanitization of the data being output. The use of querystring suggests possible URL parameter handling, though it's not clearly utilized in the shown snippet.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: Medium. The code exposes system information via stdout and lacks input validation for network requests.",
