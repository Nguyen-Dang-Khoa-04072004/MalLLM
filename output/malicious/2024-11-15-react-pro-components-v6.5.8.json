    ],
    "analysis": "The code performs several suspicious operations including collecting sensitive system information (IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user info) and sending it to a remote Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL indicates potential data exfiltration capabilities. The code also fetches external IP information from an external service, which could be part of a larger tracking mechanism. This behavior is typically associated with malware or tracking software.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates high-risk behavior with clear indicators of data exfiltration through a Discord webhook. It collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server without user consent, making it highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
