It collects various system attributes including IP addresses, hostnames, user information, and package metadata, then transmits this data via HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the comprehensive nature of the collected data strongly suggests malicious intent for data theft or system reconnaissance.",
