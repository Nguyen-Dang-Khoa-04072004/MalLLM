    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including IP addresses, hostname, user info, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This constitutes a clear case of unauthorized data exfiltration where sensitive system information is being transmitted without user consent. The use of ipinfo.io to determine external IP address adds another layer of tracking capability.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code that performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. It violates user privacy by transmitting system information to an external server without explicit consent.",
