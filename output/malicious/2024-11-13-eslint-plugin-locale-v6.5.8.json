    "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to collect system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, and package details, then send this data to a Discord webhook for tracking purposes.",
    "analysis": "This code appears to be part of a malicious npm package designed to exfiltrate system information and send it to a remote Discord webhook. It collects various system details including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, DNS configurations, and package metadata. The collected data is sent via HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common method for command-and-control communication in malware. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a security risk as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission."
