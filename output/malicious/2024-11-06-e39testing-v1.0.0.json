    "purpose": "The code appears to download and execute a file from a remote URL using PowerShell commands. This is typical of malware behavior, as it involves downloading and running arbitrary code from an external source.",

    "sinks": [
        "execAsync function call (lines 14, 15)",

    "anomalies": [
        "Use of child_process.execAsync without input validation",

        "Potential for arbitrary code execution through downloaded files",
        "Hardcoded malicious URL patterns"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code downloads and executes a file from a remote URL using PowerShell commands. It takes a URL and output file path, then uses PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to download and Start-Process to execute the downloaded file. The use of dynamic command construction with user-provided inputs creates a high-risk vulnerability for command injection and arbitrary code execution.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of malicious code execution due to downloading and executing files from untrusted sources. The code lacks input validation and sanitization, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.",
