    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this data to multiple external domains that appear to be tracking/monitoring services. The code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the collected MAC addresses and makes HTTP requests without proper SSL verification, suggesting potential data exfiltration. This behavior is typically associated with spyware or tracking software.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software that collects system information and exfiltrates it to remote servers without user consent.",
