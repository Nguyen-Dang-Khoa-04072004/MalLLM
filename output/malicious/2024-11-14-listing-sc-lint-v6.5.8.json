    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system and package information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this data via HTTPS to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The presence of system information collection combined with external data transmission raises significant privacy and security concerns. The code also uses unusual patterns like the '___resolved' field which may indicate obfuscation or specific package management behavior.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a data collection and exfiltration mechanism that poses a high security risk by transmitting potentially sensitive system information to an external service without user consent.",
