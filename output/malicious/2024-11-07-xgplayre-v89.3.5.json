    "analysis": "The code collects various system information including hostname, username, home directory, and IP address through network requests. It then sends this information to multiple external domains using HTTP GET requests. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates an attempt to bypass SSL certificate validation, which is commonly used in malicious payloads to avoid detection. Multiple suspicious domains are hard-coded, suggesting potential data exfiltration behavior.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software designed to collect system information and transmit it to remote servers. It represents a clear security risk involving unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
