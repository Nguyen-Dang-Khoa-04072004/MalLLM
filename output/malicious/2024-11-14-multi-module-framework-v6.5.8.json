    ],
    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, user information, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of personal/system identifiers strongly suggests this is either a tracking mechanism or malicious telemetry code. The external IP lookup via ipinfo.io is also a red flag for potential data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits high-risk behavior with clear indicators of unauthorized data collection and transmission to external services. It's highly likely malicious or at minimum a serious security risk due to the hard-coded webhook URL and comprehensive system information gathering.",
