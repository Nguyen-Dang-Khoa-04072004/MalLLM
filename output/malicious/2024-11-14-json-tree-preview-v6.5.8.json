    "analysis": "The code collects various system details including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, DNS servers, username, and package information. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves automatic data exfiltration without explicit user consent. The presence of multiple network-related functions and the obvious intent to send data externally indicates this is likely malicious tracking code.",
    "conclusion": "This code is malicious and represents a security risk. It automatically collects and sends sensitive system information to an external server without user consent.",
