    "analysis": "This code performs several potentially malicious activities: it collects comprehensive system and network information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, user credentials, DNS configuration, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The purpose appears to be unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. The code uses standard Node.js modules but combines them in a way that compromises user privacy and system security.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a clear security risk as it collects and transmits sensitive system information without consent to an external service. It exhibits characteristics of malicious software by performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
