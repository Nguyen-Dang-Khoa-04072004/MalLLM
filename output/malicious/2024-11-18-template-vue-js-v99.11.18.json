    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system identifiers like MAC addresses, hostname, and user information. It then transmits this data to multiple external domains that appear to be part of security testing infrastructure. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates potential attempts to bypass security checks. This behavior is typical of telemetry or tracking code often found in malicious software.",
