    "analysis": "The code is designed to collect comprehensive system and package information and transmit it via HTTPS to a Discord webhook. It gathers both internal and external IP addresses, user information, DNS settings, and package metadata. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates potential malicious intent or unauthorized data collection. The code sends potentially sensitive information to an external server without any form of encryption or authentication, creating a significant security risk.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code collects and transmits sensitive system and user information to an external server without consent or proper security measures. This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and poses a serious privacy and security threat.",
