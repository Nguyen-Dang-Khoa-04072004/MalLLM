    "analysis": "The code collects various system attributes including IP address, hostname, username, and directory information, then sends this data to multiple external domains via HTTP GET requests. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of telemetry or tracking functionality. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests potential attempts to bypass security measures.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to remote servers without explicit user consent. It poses a significant privacy and security risk.",
