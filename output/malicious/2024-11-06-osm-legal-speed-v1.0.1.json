{
    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of an npm package that retrieves legal speed limit information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data via HTTPS requests. It uses Node.js built-in modules like 'os', 'dns', 'https', and 'querystring' to gather system information and make network requests.",
    "sources": [
        "os.hostname()",
        "os.userInfo()"

    "sinks": [
        "process.stdout.write(d)"

    "flows": [
        "os.hostname() -> process.stdout.write(d)",

    "anomalies": [
        "The code does not properly close the HTTPS request stream",
        "The 'd' variable in the 'data' event handler is not declared with 'let' or 'const'",
        "There is no error handling for the HTTPS request or DNS resolution"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code makes an HTTPS request to fetch OSM data and writes it to stdout. It also gathers system information using os.hostname() and os.userInfo(), which could potentially expose sensitive system details. The lack of proper error handling and resource cleanup presents security risks.",
    "conclusion": "The code has potential security vulnerabilities related to improper resource management, lack of error handling, and possible information exposure through system information gathering.",
