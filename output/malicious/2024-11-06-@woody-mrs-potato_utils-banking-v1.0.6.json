{
    "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, including IP address, hostname, platform details, and package.json content, then sends this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request.",
    "analysis": "The script collects various pieces of system information such as OS details, hostname, IP addresses, current working directory, and the contents of a package.json file encoded in base64. It then constructs a URL with these details and makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server. This behavior strongly suggests that the code is attempting to exfiltrate system information for malicious purposes or as part of a security test.",
    "conclusion": "This code presents a high security risk due to its intent to exfiltrate system information to an external server without proper authorization or encryption.",
