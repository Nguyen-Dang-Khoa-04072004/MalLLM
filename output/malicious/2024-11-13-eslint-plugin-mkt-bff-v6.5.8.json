{
    "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package that collects system information and sends it via a Discord webhook. It retrieves internal and external IP addresses, system details, and package metadata.",
    "analysis": "The code retrieves extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, DNS servers, and package metadata. This data is then formatted into JSON and sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This constitutes a significant security risk as it can lead to unauthorized data collection and potential exposure of sensitive system information.",
    "conclusion": "High security risk due to unauthorized data exfiltration to a third-party service using a hardcoded webhook URL. Sensitive system information is being collected and transmitted without user consent or knowledge.",
