    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details, then transmits this data to external domains using HTTP requests. The presence of hardcoded domains typically associated with tracking or malicious activities raises significant security concerns. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates potential insecure communication practices. This behavior is typical of malware or tracking scripts designed to gather device information and report it to remote servers.",
