    ],
    "analysis": "The code performs several suspicious activities: it gathers unique MAC addresses from network interfaces, collects hostname and user information, encodes this data in base64, and sends it to known tracking domains via HTTP GET requests. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' suggests potential man-in-the-middle attack capabilities, and the hardcoded domain names point toward telemetry or monitoring services.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of malicious software designed for data collection and exfiltration. It gathers system identifiers and transmits them to remote servers without encryption verification, which is typically associated with surveillance or tracking tools.",
