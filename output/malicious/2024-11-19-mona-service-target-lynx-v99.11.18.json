    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then establishes HTTP connections to predetermined external domains, likely for data exfiltration purposes. The use of self-signed certificates ('rejectUnauthorized: false') and hardcoded C2 domains suggests malicious intent. The code also performs base64 encoding of collected data before transmission.",
    "conclusion": "This code represents a security risk with potential malware-like behavior due to unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to external domains.",
