    ],
    "analysis": "This code performs system reconnaissance by gathering various pieces of identifying information including IP addresses, hostname, OS details, and package metadata. The most concerning aspect is its hardcoded Discord webhook URL that sends all collected data externally. This represents a clear case of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. The code also makes external HTTP requests to ipinfo.io for geolocation data, and uses standard Node.js modules like os, dns, and https. There are structural issues with the network interface handling logic that may cause runtime errors, and the code lacks proper error handling for network operations.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior through unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external server. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
