It then encrypts this data using a fixed key and sends it to a remote server via HTTPS POST request. The presence of hardcoded credentials, encryption keys, and a known malicious webhook URL indicates this is likely malware designed to exfiltrate system information for unauthorized purposes.",
    "conclusion": "High-risk security threat. This is a malicious payload designed to collect system information and exfiltrate it to a remote server. Contains multiple indicators of compromise including hardcoded credentials, suspicious encryption methods, and known malicious endpoints.",
