    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, DNS settings, hostname, user information, and package metadata. It then sends all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which likely violates privacy policies and could expose sensitive information about the user's environment to an external party.",
