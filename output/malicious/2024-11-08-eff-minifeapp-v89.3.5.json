    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including IP address, hostname, username, and directory paths, then sends this data to external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, likely data exfiltration or tracking. The use of hardcoded domains ending in '.oast.fun' and similar patterns suggests these are tracking servers. Additionally, the code disables SSL certificate verification which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malware or unwanted tracking behavior. It collects and transmits system information to remote servers without user consent, making it a high-risk security issue.",
