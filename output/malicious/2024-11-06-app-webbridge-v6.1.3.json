    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package details including IP addresses, DNS settings, username, hostname, and package metadata. It then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is typical of telemetry or tracking code that reports system information to an external server. The use of ipinfo.io to fetch external IP addresses and hostname information adds to the scope of collected data.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits telemetry/tracking behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external service. The hardcoded Discord webhook URL indicates intentional data exfiltration.",
