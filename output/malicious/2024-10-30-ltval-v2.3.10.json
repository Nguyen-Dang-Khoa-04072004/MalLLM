    "analysis": "The code contains several security vulnerabilities. Most critically, it uses eval() on base64 decoded content which is highly indicative of malware or obfuscated code execution. Additionally, there are potential command injection points through shell execution and insecure environment variable handling. The code also attempts to manipulate process.env directly without proper validation or sanitization.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of malicious code execution due to eval() usage on decoded base64 content, potential command injection, and insecure environment variable handling.",
