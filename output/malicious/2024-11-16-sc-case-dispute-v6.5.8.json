    "analysis": "This code performs several potentially malicious actions including gathering comprehensive system information such as internal/external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, indicating possible data exfiltration. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the nature of the operation strongly suggest malicious intent.",
    "conclusion": "This code has high likelihood of being malicious due to its data collection and exfiltration behavior to a third-party service.",
