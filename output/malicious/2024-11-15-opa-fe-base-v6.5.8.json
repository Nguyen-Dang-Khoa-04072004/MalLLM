    "analysis": "This code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code uses unverified HTTPS requests and transmits potentially sensitive system information externally without proper consent or security measures. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of telemetry or data exfiltration functionality.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed to collect system information and send it to an external Discord webhook. It poses a significant security risk by exposing sensitive system data.",
