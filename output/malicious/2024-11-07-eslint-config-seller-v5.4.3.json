    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal and external IP addresses, hostnames, user information, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a Discord webhook, which could be used for tracking, analytics, or malicious purposes. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the transmission of potentially sensitive data raises significant security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code exhibits behavior typical of telemetry or tracking software that collects system information and transmits it to an external server without explicit user consent.",
