    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information including IP address, hostname, username, and directory paths, then sends this data to multiple external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malware or unwanted tracking software. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates an attempt to bypass security measures, which is commonly seen in malicious code.",
