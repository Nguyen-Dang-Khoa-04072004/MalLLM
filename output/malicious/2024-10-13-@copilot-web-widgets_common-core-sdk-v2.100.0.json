{
    "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to monitor package installations and send detailed information about the installation event, including system details, directory contents, and external IP, to a Discord webhook for potential dependency confusion attack detection.",
    "analysis": "This code appears to be part of a malicious package designed to exfiltrate information from compromised systems. It collects various system and environment details, including external IP, current directory contents, and sensitive project files, then sends this data to a Discord webhook. This behavior is consistent with tools used for dependency confusion attacks or general system reconnaissance. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates this is likely part of a botnet or command-and-control infrastructure.",
    "conclusion": "This code poses a significant security risk as it exfiltrates sensitive system information to an external server without user consent. It's designed to collect potentially valuable data for malicious purposes such as dependency confusion attacks or system reconnaissance.",
    "confidence": 0.95
