    "analysis": "This code is clearly designed for data collection and exfiltration. It gathers extensive system information including both internal and external IP addresses, DNS configuration, hostname, username, and package metadata. The collected data is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, indicating potential surveillance or telemetry capabilities. This behavior is highly suspicious and typically associated with malicious software that collects system information for unauthorized purposes.",
    "conclusion": "This code demonstrates clear signs of malicious activity through unauthorized data collection and transmission to external services. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and comprehensive system information gathering strongly suggests it's designed to exfiltrate user data without consent.",
