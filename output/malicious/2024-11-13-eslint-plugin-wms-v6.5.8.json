    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including IP addresses, hostnames, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends this data via HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a significant privacy risk as it transmits potentially sensitive information about the user's system environment to an external party without explicit user consent. The code also makes an unvalidated external HTTP request to ipinfo.io which could be exploited for tracking or data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code violates privacy best practices by collecting and transmitting sensitive system information to an external service without user consent. It exposes internal network details and could be used for tracking users across different systems.",
