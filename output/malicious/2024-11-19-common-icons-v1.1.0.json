    "analysis": "This code implements multiple malicious patterns including data exfiltration to external servers, reverse shell establishment, and system reconnaissance. The presence of hardcoded domains, base64-encoded sensitive data in HTTP headers, and reverse shell functionality clearly indicates malicious intent. The code gathers system information (network interfaces, user info, platform details) and sends it along with command execution results to remote servers.",
    "conclusion": "This is highly likely malicious code implementing a reverse shell and data exfiltration capability.",
