    ],
    "analysis": "This code demonstrates a clear pattern of information gathering followed by data exfiltration. It collects hostname, user info, and current working directory through child_process.exec(), then sends all this sensitive information to an external domain (qysjyxckktuue9hnbgmhqc9cw32uqlea.oastify.com). This is characteristic of malicious software that harvests system information for surveillance or further attack vectors. The use of HTTPS for transmission suggests an attempt to evade detection while maintaining communication with command-and-control infrastructure.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior indicative of a trojan or information stealer. It gathers system fingerprinting data and transmits it to a remote server, posing a significant security risk.",
