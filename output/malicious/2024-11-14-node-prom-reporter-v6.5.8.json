    "analysis": "This code performs several concerning actions: it collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, and package details. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint, which likely serves as a command-and-control channel for data exfiltration. The presence of multiple data sources and sinks, combined with the hardcoded webhook URL, indicates this is likely malicious code designed to report system information to an attacker's server.",
    "conclusion": "This is highly likely malicious code designed for data exfiltration. The hardcoded Discord webhook URL and comprehensive system information collection make it clear that this code is intended to send sensitive data to an external party.",
