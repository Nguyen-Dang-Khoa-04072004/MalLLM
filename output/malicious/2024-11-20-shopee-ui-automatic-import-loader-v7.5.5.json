    "analysis": "This code is highly suspicious as it collects comprehensive system information including IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata, then automatically sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL suggests potential data exfiltration capabilities, which is a clear security risk. The code uses multiple Node.js modules related to networking (os, dns, https) to gather detailed system information and transmits it externally without user consent.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code that collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server via Discord webhook. It represents a high-security risk.",
