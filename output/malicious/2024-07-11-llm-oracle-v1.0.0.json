    "purpose": "The code appears to be attempting to copy a file and execute it with elevated privileges using PowerShell commands, potentially as part of a malicious payload or unauthorized system modification.",
    "analysis": "The code demonstrates suspicious behavior involving file copying, PowerShell command execution with bypass policies, and attempts to run executables with elevated privileges. It uses obfuscation techniques like string replacement and delays to evade detection. This pattern is commonly associated with malware or unauthorized system modifications.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of malicious intent due to use of PowerShell execution policy bypass, privilege escalation, and file manipulation.",
