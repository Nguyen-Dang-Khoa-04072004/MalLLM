    "anomalies": [
        "Use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' in HTTPS options, which disables SSL certificate verification",
        "Concatenation of user input (process.argv[2]) with hostname in URL construction, potentially leading to DNS rebind attacks",
        "Hardcoded port number 443 used without validation"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects the system hostname and a project ID from command line arguments, then constructs a JSON payload containing this information. It sends this data to a remote server using HTTPS but with disabled certificate verification. The hostname is also used to construct the target URL by concatenating it with the project ID argument, which could be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks if not properly validated. The use of rejectUnauthorized: false is a significant security concern as it makes the application susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code has multiple vulnerabilities including potential DNS rebinding, insecure HTTPS configuration, and possible injection of malicious data into the target URL.",
