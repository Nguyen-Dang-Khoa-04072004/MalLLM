    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, and user details. It then sends this information to multiple external domains that appear to be part of a tracking or monitoring service (based on the .oast domains). The use of rejectUnauthorized: false suggests potential attempts to bypass SSL certificate validation, which is often seen in malicious code to avoid detection. The code also uses base64 encoding for the MAC addresses, indicating possible obfuscation.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of telemetry or data exfiltration malware. It collects system identifiers and sends them to remote servers without clear legitimate purpose.",
