    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal IP, external IP, hostname, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This constitutes a potential security risk as it transmits sensitive system information without explicit user consent. The code also has potential issues with error handling and uses direct stdout writing which might be problematic in certain environments.",
    "conclusion": "Security Risk: High. The code performs unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external service, violating privacy and potentially exposing system information.",
