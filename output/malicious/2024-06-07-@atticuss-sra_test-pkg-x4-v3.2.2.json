    "purpose": "The code implements a Fraction class for handling rational numbers with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, comparison, and conversion to string or decimal representations. It includes parsing of various input formats and support for continued fractions and decimal representations.",

    "anomalies": [
        "Potential division by zero in line 65 when d === 0",
        "Use of deprecated or non-standard property access syntax with bracket notation like ['s'], ['n'], ['d'] instead of dot notation",
        "Inconsistent handling of negative signs where sign is stored separately in 's' and absolute value in 'n'/'d'",
        "Potential integer overflow when computing large powers in exponentiation operation",
        "Possible infinite loop in toContinued() method if the continued fraction expansion does not converge as expected"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive Fraction class with various mathematical operations. Key issues include potential division by zero, inconsistent negative sign handling, possible integer overflow during exponentiation, and risk of infinite loops in continued fraction computation. The implementation uses a combination of mathematical algorithms (GCD, prime factorization) and string manipulation for parsing and formatting. The code appears to be functional but contains several areas where edge cases may not be properly handled, particularly around boundary conditions and numerical precision.",
    "conclusion": "The Fraction class has potential security vulnerabilities due to lack of input validation and potential arithmetic errors, but primarily represents a math library implementation rather than a direct security concern.",
