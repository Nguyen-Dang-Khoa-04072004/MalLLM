    "analysis": "This code performs system reconnaissance by collecting various identifiers such as internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then transmits this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook endpoint. The external IP is fetched from ipinfo.io, and the system information is packaged into a JSON structure before being sent over HTTPS. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of telemetry or data exfiltration functionality.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear telemetry/exfiltration behavior with a hardcoded Discord webhook destination, making it highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
