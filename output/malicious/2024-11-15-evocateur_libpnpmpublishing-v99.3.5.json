    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user details, then transmits this data to known malicious domains. The use of hardcoded C2 (command and control) domains like 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com' indicates this is likely part of a malware or spyware payload. The 'rejectUnauthorized: false' setting suggests attempts to bypass security measures. This represents a high-severity security risk as it exfiltrates device information to remote servers.",
    "conclusion": "This is malicious code designed for data exfiltration. It collects system identifiers and sends them to external command-and-control servers.",
