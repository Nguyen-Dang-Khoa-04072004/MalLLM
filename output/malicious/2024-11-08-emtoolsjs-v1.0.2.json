    "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system information including hostname, operating system, and architecture, then sends this data over HTTPS to an external server. This behavior is typical of telemetry or monitoring tools but raises privacy concerns if not explicitly intended by the user or application owner. The hardcoded endpoint suggests it may be part of a tracking mechanism rather than legitimate functionality.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially unwanted telemetry behavior by sending system information to a remote server without clear user consent. This poses a privacy risk as it involves data exfiltration.",
