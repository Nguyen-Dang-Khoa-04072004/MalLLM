    "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses and hostname, then transmits this data to third-party domains. The presence of hardcoded domain names commonly used in security testing or tracking suggests potential malicious intent. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates possible attempts to bypass security checks.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of potentially malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains without clear user consent.",
