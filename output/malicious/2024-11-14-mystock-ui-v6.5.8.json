    "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, username, DNS settings, and package metadata. It then sends this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission without explicit user consent. The code uses multiple Node.js modules (os, dns, https) to gather information and makes HTTP requests to external services.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server. It's likely part of a data collection or surveillance tool.",
