    ],
    "analysis": "This code collects sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, and user information. It then sends this data to multiple external domains through HTTP GET requests. The external domains appear to be part of a tracking/c2 infrastructure based on their naming pattern. The use of 'rejectUnauthorized: false' indicates potential man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability. The code also employs base64 encoding of MAC addresses, suggesting attempts at obfuscation.",
    "conclusion": "This is highly suspicious code that appears to be sending system fingerprint data to external tracking servers. It poses significant privacy and security risks by collecting and transmitting sensitive system information without user consent.",
