    "analysis": "This code collects various system identifiers including MAC addresses, hostname, and user information, then sends them to hardcoded external domains over unencrypted HTTP connections. The presence of multiple tracking domains and the disabling of SSL certificate verification suggests this code may be used for telemetry or surveillance purposes. The inclusion of base64 encoding for MAC addresses indicates an attempt at obfuscation, though the overall purpose remains clear as data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "This code exhibits characteristics of telemetry/malware behavior by collecting system information and sending it to external domains without proper encryption or authorization.",
