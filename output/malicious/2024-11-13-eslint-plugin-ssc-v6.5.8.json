    ],
    "analysis": "The code collects various system and package information including internal and external IP addresses, hostname, user details, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking behavior. The use of external IP lookup via ipinfo.io suggests attempts to gather network information. Critical security concerns include the hardcoded webhook URL, lack of input validation, and sending sensitive system information to an external service without explicit user consent.",
    "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to a remote Discord webhook without user consent. This represents a significant security risk involving unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
