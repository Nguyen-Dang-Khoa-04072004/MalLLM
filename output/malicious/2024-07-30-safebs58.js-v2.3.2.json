        "Hardcoded network endpoint with unclear purpose",
        "Use of deprecated or unsafe string manipulation techniques"
    ],
    "analysis": "The code contains several security concerns including potential information leakage via network requests, unsafe file system operations, and improper input validation. The wordlist processing appears designed to extract and validate mnemonic phrases which could be used maliciously if not properly secured. The use of node-fetch and direct filesystem access raises flags for potential privilege escalation or data exfiltration.",
    "conclusion": "The code presents multiple security risks including potential data exfiltration, insecure file handling, and untrusted network communications that could lead to compromise of user data or system integrity.",
