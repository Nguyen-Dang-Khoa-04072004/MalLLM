    "analysis": "The code collects various system and network details such as internal IP, external IP, hostname, user info, and package metadata. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This represents a clear security risk as it exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information without explicit user consent. The use of hardcoded credentials and the transmission of personal identifiers like usernames and hostnames raises serious privacy and security concerns.",
    "conclusion": "High risk of unauthorized data exfiltration. The code contains malicious behavior by transmitting system information to an external service without user consent, violating privacy and security best practices.",
